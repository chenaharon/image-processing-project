# Results Directory

This directory holds **comparison** outputs when you run all pipelines and generate the final comparison. Per-pipeline results (models, plots, visualizations) are stored in **pipeline-specific directories** at the project root.

---

## Where results are stored

| Output | Location |
|--------|----------|
| **Comparison** (all pipelines) | `results/comparison/` (this directory) |
| **Baseline** | `results_baseline/` or `results/baseline/` |
| **Improved** | `results_improved/` |
| **Multiclass** | `results_multiclass/` |
| **Deep Learning** | `results_deep_learning/` |

---

## Comparison outputs (this directory)

After running:

```bash
python src/orchestration/run_all_pipelines.py
python src/orchestration/generate_final_comparison.py
```

you will find under `results/comparison/`:

- **comparison_metrics.csv** — Metrics table across pipelines.
- **all_pipelines_comparison.txt** — Text report comparing all pipelines.
- Other comparison artifacts (e.g. plots) if generated by the script.

## Per-pipeline outputs (project root)

Each pipeline writes to its own directory (e.g. `results_baseline/`). Typical contents:

- **Training:** `classifier.pkl` or `model.pth`, `training_config.pkl`, `label_mapping.pkl`
- **Evaluation:** `plots/`, `per_video_breakdown.csv`, `per_class_metrics.csv`, `confusion_matrix_detailed.csv`, `metrics_summary.txt`
- **Visualization:** `visualizations/*.mp4` (color-coded block overlay videos)

Heavy files (e.g. `.mp4`, `.pkl`, `.pth`) are listed in the project [.gitignore](../.gitignore) and are not committed.

## Notes

- Ensure at least one pipeline has been run (and its results directory exists) before generating the final comparison.
- For run instructions, see the main [README.md](../README.md).
